/*
 *  This class implements a base class for tasks, that is, objects that
 *  implement a `run` function and have a state that can be queried.
 *
 *  The state of a task can be one of three states: CREATED, RUNNING, and
 *  FINISHED. The state transitions are as follows:
 *
 *      CREATED -> RUNNING      on call to `finish`, if `run` returns true
 *      RUNNING -> FINISHED     on call to `finish`, if `run` returns true
 *
 *  The `finish` function returns true if the task has completed,
 *  regardless of whether the task is still running or has completed. The
 *  `get_state` function returns the current state of the task.
 *
 *  The `run` function must be implemented by the derived class, and is
 *  called by the `finish` function when the task is in the CREATED state.
 *  The `run` function must return true if the task has completed, and
 *  false otherwise.
 *
 *  The `enter_state` function is used by the derived class to enter the
 *  FINISHED state, and is used internally by the finish function to
 *  transition from the CREATED state to the RUNNING state.
 *
 *  The `finished` event is dispatched when the task enters the FINISHED
 *  state, and is used by the caller of `finish` to wait for the task to
 *  complete, or to perform some action after the task has completed.
